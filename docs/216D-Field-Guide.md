# 216D Field Guide for Foremen & PMs

## 🛑 STOP! Read Before You Dig.

This system protects you, the crew, and the company from OPS fines and safety incidents. Follow these steps for every bore.

### 1. White Lining (The "Paint It" Rule)
**Requirement**: You must physically mark the proposed excavation area with white paint or flags.
**In Nexus**:
1.  Go to the **216D / GSOC** tab on the project.
2.  Click "White Lining".
3.  Upload a photo of your white marks.
4.  Enter a precise description (e.g., "Boring from Pedestal A to Pedestal B, 10ft offset from curb").
5.  **Why?** If you don't mark it, the ticket isn't valid.

### 2. Filing the Ticket (The "Call It" Rule)
**Requirement**: File the ticket with GSOC.
**In Nexus**:
1.  After white lining, enter the **Ticket Number** and **Confirmation Time**.
2.  Nexus will calculate your **Legal Locate Ready** time.
3.  **WAIT**: Do not dig until the "Green to Dig" badge appears.

### 3. Meet Tickets (The "Long Haul" Rule)
**Requirement**: If your job is **> 1 mile** or crosses **county lines**, you MUST schedule a Meet.
**In Nexus**:
1.  Select "Meet Ticket" type.
2.  Enter the **Meet Date & Time**.
3.  Nexus sets your dig start time to **48 hours AFTER the meet**.

### 4. In the Field (The "Cover Your A**" Rule)
**Marks Gone or Wrong?**
-   Don't guess.
-   Open **Field Dashboard** -> **Safety**.
-   Tap **REQUEST REMARK**.
-   Take a photo of the faded/missing marks.
-   This proves you tried to keep marks visible.

**Hit Something?**
-   **STOP WORK**.
-   Call 911 if gas/hazardous.
-   Open **Field Dashboard** -> **Safety**.
-   Tap **REPORT DAMAGE**.
-   Log who you called and when.
-   Take photos of the damage.

### 5. The "OPS Packet"
If an inspector shows up, hit **Export Packet** on the project page. It gives them everything they need:
-   Your ticket.
-   Your white lining photo.
-   Your timeline of events.
-   Proof you followed the law.
