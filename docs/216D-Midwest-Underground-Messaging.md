# 216D Compliance: The "Sleep at Night" Upgrade

## The Problem
Excavation law (MN Statute 216D) is complex, strict, and expensive.
-   **$1,000/day fines** for paperwork errors.
-   **Liability** if you hit a line and can't prove you followed the rules.
-   **Wasted time** calculating "48 hours excluding weekends and holidays" at 6 AM.

## The Nexus Solution
We turned the law into code. Nexus doesn't just "track" tickets; it **enforces** compliance.

### 1. Automated Math
No more counting days on a calendar. Nexus knows the holidays. It knows the weekends. It tells you exactly when you can legally put a bucket in the ground.
*   *Benefit*: Eliminates "start too early" violations.

### 2. Forced White Lining
You can't even file a ticket in Nexus until you upload a photo of your white lining.
*   *Benefit*: 100% proof that you marked the area. No utility can say "we didn't know where to locate."

### 3. The "Meet Ticket" Trap
Long projects (>1 mile) require Meet Tickets. Most software misses this. Nexus flags it automatically.
*   *Benefit*: Prevents the most common "process violation" for large projects.

### 4. One-Click Defense
When OPS or a utility claims you messed up, you don't dig through truck cabs for paper. You click **"Export Packet"**.
*   *Benefit*: Instant, professional PDF evidence of every step you took.

## Why This Matters
This isn't just software; it's **insurance**. It turns your field data into a legal shield. It lets your foremen focus on drilling, knowing the office has their back on compliance.
