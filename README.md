## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🚜 Asset Management (New!)
- **Fleet Tracking**: Manage Drills, Excavators, Trucks, and Locators.
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time status (Available, In Use, Maintenance).
- **Project Assignment**: Assign assets to specific job sites.

### 2. 📈 Linear Progress Tracking (New!)
- **Station-Based**: Track progress by footage (e.g., "Station 100 to 250").
- **Activity Logging**: Log specific activities (Pilot, Ream, Pullback).
- **Visual Dashboard**: Progress bars and completion stats per project.

### 3. 🧮 Core Engineering (Rust Engine)
- **Physics Engine**: ASTM F1962 Pullback & Hydraulic Fracture modeling.
- **Geometry**: Minimum Curvature Method (MCM) for precise 3D path calculations.
- **Performance**: Rust-based backend (`/engine`) exposed via Axum API.

### 4. 🌍 Digital Subsurface
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive view of bore paths and soil layers.
- **Geotech Integration**: Manage soil borings and stratigraphy.

### 5. 📡 Live Operations
- **Telemetry**: Ingest WITSML data from rigs.
- **Live Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of depth, pitch, and azimuth.
